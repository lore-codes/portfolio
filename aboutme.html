                    <h2>Education</h2>
                    <p>
                        I am currently a student at the University of Wisconsin - Oshkosh. 
                        I am a Computer Science major, and I may also pursue a certificate 
                        in web design. Currently, I am estimated to graduate in 2027, but 
                        I may graduate sooner if my classes go well.

                        <h3>Object-Oriented Programming</h3>
                        <p>
                            I have a strong foundation in the fundamentals of object-oriented 
                            programming, with a focus on programming in Java. I have experience 
                            with all of the basics of selection, repetition, and both primitive 
                            and wrapper data types, as well as a reasonable degree of competency 
                            with the basics of classes and user defined objects. I understand 
                            and implement the principles of abstraction, encapsulation, and 
                            modularity to the best of my ability. I have also had some limited 
                            experience with programming in C++.

                        <h3>Web Design</h3>
                        <p>
                            I have some basic understanding of the rudiments of web design. I 
                            have learned basic HTML and CSS, and I have been taught the importance 
                            of using elements properly, not just for aesthetics, as well as how to 
                            use headings and navigational regions correctly for screenreader 
                            accessibility. I am still quite new to web design, but I am determined 
                            to improve, and in fact, practicing and improving my skills in web 
                            development is a large part of why I decided to begin making this site 
                            in the first place.

                        <h3>Other Experience</h3>
                        <p>
                            I have spent roughly four months working at the UW Oshkosh IT support 
                            desk, and I will return to work there in Fall 2025. I do have to ask my 
                            ever-patient boss questions all the time, but I hope to continue to 
                            improve and understand the work more with time. While this isn't 
                            necessarily programming, it is related to technology, and it has given 
                            me experience working with ticketing software (JIRA) and internal 
                            documentation (KnowledgeBase).

                    <h2>Personal Life</h2>
                    <p>
                        My goal once I graduate is to go into software engineering. I am legally 
                        blind, and as such, accessible tech is near and dear to my heart, and I 
                        have a passion for learning how to make technology more accessible. I 
                        also have an interest in robotics, and love seeing the code I write 
                        make something happen in the real world. I am a proud member of the 
                        LGBTQIA+ community, and I do not tolerate bigotry or prejudice in any 
                        form. Outside of coding, I enjoy reading, baking, and playing D&D in my 
                        free time (hence several of my projects being D&D-related; they are 
                        tools that I made for myself).
