                <p>
                    I am still a new programmer, and most of my projects are either homework 
                    from college or related to my hobbies, but I figured that posting them could
                    be useful nonetheless. At the very least, posting means that I've had to 
                    learn about git and how to use it. I will be adding more projects as I upload 
                    them to GitHub, and then more as I complete them, but for now, I have two 
                    projects. Neither are very polished, I do plan on improving them, but this is 
                    what I have for now.

                        This is a basic generator that can be used to create simple, randomized 
                        settlements for tabletop roleplaying games (TTRPGs), such as Dungeons & 
                        Dragons.It has a simple menu interface, can create any number of randomly 
                        generated settlements, and can save them for later use.

                        This is a basic generator that creates randomized nonplayer characters 
                        (NPCs) that can be used in D&D and other TTRPGs, based off of the rolling 
                        tables in the 2024 Dungeon Master's Guide. It uses a simple menu interface, 
                        and can save generated characters to be viewed later.
